Getting Data project - Data Science Johns Hopkins
=================================================
run_analysis.R is the script for the Getting Data project.


Short Description
=================================================
This repo contains the run_analysis.R script that downloads the base data 
and transforms it to a tidy dataset. After that, it computes the average 
of the selected features.

Running the script
=================================================
The script run_analysis.R will download the dataset, unzip it, read it in, and 
write a tidy dataset in a file named "merged_MeanStd.txt". After it, it will 
write the computed average values in a file named "tidy_MeltMeans.txt".

This script works with the file paths in Windows-style.
